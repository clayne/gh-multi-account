The config file is named "tokens.conf" and goes in the directory
$GH_CONFIG_DIR/multi-account, where GH_CONFIG_DIR is usually $HOME/.config/gh

Lines in the config file take the format of "token_id: token" (without the
quotes).  Multiple spaces and tabs are allowed between the colon and the.  The
colon can be omitted if there is at least one whitespace character between the
id and the token.  The token id must start at the beginning of the line, with
no whitespace in front of it.

A token id has three different formats.  From most specific to least
specific, the formats are:

    host/account/repo
    host/account
    host

The most specific id which matches the current repo will be used.

Example token ids:

    github.com/google/guava
    github.com/google
    github.com

If the token value is either "none" (without the quotes) or blank then the
wrapper script will pass no token to the GitHub CLI executable, allowing the
normal authentication flow to happen.

The order of the lines is unimportant, except when the exact same token id is
used multiple times, in which case the last line using that token id is the one
which will count.

Empty lines and lines starting with a "#" are ignored.

An example config line, with the token redacted:

github.com/google/guava:    ****************************************
